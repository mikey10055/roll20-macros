# Roll20 macros

### How to use

##### Install browser extentions
Get Tampermonkey ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)/[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)), and install the 5etools companion script using this [link](https://get.5e.tools/script/betteR20-5etools.user.js)! This userscript allows you to import much of 5etools' data without paying a dime.

Please note: the script currently depends on [Roll20 Enhancement Suite](https://ssstormy.github.io/roll20-enhancement-suite/), an external browser extension, to function. Please ensure you have the latest version of the Enhancement Suite installed in order to use the script.

As a player, you can import character options, spells, and items to quickly fill out a sheet. As a GM, you can make handout copies of these, as well as import monsters, objects, and adventures.

To import monsters, your game must have a default character sheet. We strongly recommend using OGL when importing, then switching to another afterwards if desired.

If you are using the Shaped sheet, be sure to open up the NPC sheets and let them convert before using it.

Beyond importing, the script features a custom initiative tracker; the ability to add custom map/token images by URL; enhanced journal functionality; and more.

FAQ: Check the [Help page](https://5etools.com/roll20.html) for some basic pointers on how to use the script.
